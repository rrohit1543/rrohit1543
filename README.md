👋 Hi, I’m Rohit Raj

👀 I’m interested in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and intelligent systems for real-world applications (e.g., gesture recognition, sign language translation).

🌱 I’m currently working as a Product Developer and Researcher at PICT Pune, focused on AI/ML models for real-time sign language recognition and translation.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML research projects, open-source contributions, and innovative applications of computer vision or NLP.

📫 How to reach me: rrohit1543@gmail.com 

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I love cricket, travelling, and capturing moments through photography when I’m not coding or experimenting with ML models!
